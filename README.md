# BufferOverflow_Lab

Buffer Overflow something that is very daunting for many newcomers in cyber security such as myself.
Having to study for the eCPPT that I will take on Feb 6th 2024 has me going crazy in finding a guide
to create a lab enviroment where I am able to conduct buffer overflows and not damage my one and only laptop.
Conducting this research in finding a guide has become so frustrating so I will matters into my own hands by 
creating a secure environment to practice my buffer overflow skills and shellcoding.
